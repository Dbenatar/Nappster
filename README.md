# Problem Domain

Parents, especially new mums and dads, may find it a struggle to keep on top of their newborn's sleep, nappy changes and eating. We would like to create an app that can do all 3 of these and store the data in a database where the user can request it. This will show the user their baby's sleeping patterns, eating habits and nappy changes. An integrated calendar and clock will allow the data to be more precise and meaningful.

# User Stories

As a user, I want to be able to log my baby's sleep patterns with a single tap, so I can easily track and analyse their sleep schedule over time.

As a user, I want the UI to be friendly and clean so I know exactly what I need to press in order to track sleep, nappy changes or eating.

As a user, I want to be able to record the type and quantity of food my baby consumes during each feeding.

As a user, I want the app to generate weekly and monthly reports summarising my baby's sleep, nappy changes and feeding habits.

As a user, I want to be able to login securely where the app remembers all my data and can retrieve it via a click of a button.
